# Blockchain-Based Voting System

## Overview
The **Blockchain-Based Voting System** is a secure and transparent election platform leveraging blockchain technology. It integrates C++ for vote management, Solidity smart contracts for decentralization, and Web3.js for seamless blockchain interaction. 🗳️🔗

## Features
- 🔐 **Secure & Transparent** – Ensures election integrity with blockchain immutability.
- ⚖️ **Decentralized** – Eliminates central authorities, preventing manipulation.
- 🖥 **User-Friendly Interface** – Provides a web-based voting interface using Web3.js.
- 📜 **Smart Contracts** – Implements Solidity-based contracts for secure vote storage.
- 📊 **Real-Time Results** – Offers instant, tamper-proof election results.
